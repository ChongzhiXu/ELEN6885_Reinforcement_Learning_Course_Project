# ELEN6885_Reinforcement_Learning_Course_Project
Note at the front: due to the time conflict with another course project, professor Chong Li has approved us to submit the Final report one day late, thanks for caring!

The ELENE 6885 Reinforcement learning Final project folder should have the following files:
1. Markov_Chain_vs_You.py: Play RPS game with Markov Chain model 
2. LSTM_DDQN.py: Play RPS game with LSTM cell model based on DDQN, test the model with sequential input
3. Actor_Critic_Strategy.py: 
4. Epsilon_RPSLS.py : Multi-agents Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spoke based on Q-learning
5. Epsilon.py: Agents using epsilon-greedy and epsilon-greedy based Q-learning for RPS game
6. The final project report: name e6885_2021Fall_Project_reprort_hl3515_cx2273_zl3095

*To run the code, the Google Colab can be found in the link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Zlf8InlsiafkpC_es9fEAo2x8rN7N7J?usp=sharing), we also uploaded a pdf version of the Google Colab, or you can copy the code to the colab cell and run it.
*We still make the epsilon based on Q-learning model and Actor_Critic model for Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spoke game but there is no space in the report for it, so you can check the google colab and play it to see the result if you like.
* Also we set up the environment for the combat between Markov Chain and LSTM cell, because the LSTM cell lost completely, so we didnâ€™t add this part to the report.

If there is any problem like the wrong code, please contact us whenever you need to!
